## About Me

I'm a web developer based in Singur, West Bengal, India. My journey began with HTML and CSS, and now I'm fluent in JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. When I'm not coding, you'll find me composing blues songs that lament the loss of timeâ€”because time flies when you're having fun, right?
